            <p>Stock exchange is a significant factor in the capital market and often is indicative of the state of a
                countryâ€™s economy. This paper focuses on the involuted landscape of stock market analysis, utilising
                a diverse set of features and indicators extracted from historical stock data and machine learning
                techniques. We have utilised traditional statistical methods, namely, Moving Average Convergence
                Divergence (MACD), Moving Average (MA), Relative Strength Index (RSI), Stochastic Oscillator
                (%K and %D), Volume Moving Average (Volume MA), Volume Rate of Change (Volume ROC),
                Average True Range (ATR), volatility indicators, Williams %R (%R), and candlestick patterns.
                Machine Learning techniques are proving to be much more accurate and faster compared to contem-
                porary prediction techniques. The models used include K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector
                Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Bayesian Learning, Perceptron,
                and Regression models. The objective is to predict market trends as either upward or downward
                based on preceding-day stock parameters. Through simulation, it is demonstrated that Random
                Forest emerges as the most effective model. Thus, we propose it for real-time implementation as a
                headway in market trend prediction methodologies.</p>

            <p class="section"><b>Stock Market Prediction Details</b></p>
            <p>This project aims to predict stock market trends and movements using machine learning techniques
                and technical indicators extracted from historical stock data. By leveraging a diverse set of technical
                indicators, including Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), Relative Strength Index (RSI),
                Stochastic Oscillator, and Volume Rate of Change (Volume ROC), among others, we sought to capture
                key trends and patterns in the data. The dataset was sourced from yfinance, technical indicators were
                calculated for features and labels were extracted to train the ML models. Various machine learning
                algorithms, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree,
                Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Naive Bayes classifier, were trained and evaluated on the dataset
                to predict future stock market trends. Performance metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and
                F1-Score were utilized to assess the effectiveness of each model in capturing market dynamics and
                predicting price movements.</p>
